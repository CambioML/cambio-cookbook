    "# Example of generating QAs and running SFT for a 10K\n",
    "In this example, we will show you how use `uniflow` and `pykoi` to evaluate a 10k.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll use `uniflow` to generate question-answers (QAs) from a pdf using OpenAI's models via `uniflow`'s `MultiFlowPipeline`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll use `pykoi` to run supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the QAs generated by `uniflow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll use `pykoi`'s Chatbot to run the SFT model, so you can ask questions about the 10K and get answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we're using a 10K from [Nike](https://investors.nike.com/investors/news-events-and-reports/), [Amazon](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16361618), and [Alphabet](https://abc.xyz/investor/sec-filings/annual-filings/2023/).\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Note: In order to run this notebook, you need a GPU (for the `RLHF`).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to set up a conda environment to run this notebook. You can set up the environment following the [instruction](https://github.com/CambioML/cambio-recipes/tree/main#installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using uniflow and several of the pykoi modules, so you will need to install these in your environment as well:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install uniflow\n",
    "pip3 install \"pykoi[huggingface, rag, rlhf]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, you will need to install torch:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 uninstall torch\n",
    "pip3 install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121  # cu121 means cuda 12.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to run the code. Once you have the key, set it as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` within a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository.

Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, floods or droughts, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past temporarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our vendors, manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.

Our NIKE Direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms. Because of their unique design and technological elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.',\n",

For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems.
