How many marathons were selected for the sample?,22
What was the criteria for the marathons selected for the sample?,The most competitive marathons in the United States and Canada
Who was selected from the marathons?,Runners
What is the 90% confidence interval for Vaporfly effects on men's minutes?,"(-4.410, -2.298)"
What is the range of the 90% confidence interval for Vaporfly effects on women's log minutes?,"(-0.024, -0.009)"
How many models are used to present the Vaporfly effects in Table 4?,"Four models: men minutes, women minutes, men log minutes, and women log minutes."
What is the estimate and standard error for the parameter \(b_{0}\) in the 'minutes' column?,The estimate for \(b_{0}\) is 140.27 and the standard error is 0.66.
How does the estimate for \(b_{1}\) in the 'log minutes' column compare to its standard error?,"The estimate for \(b_{1}\) in the 'log minutes' column is \(-0.0229\), which is smaller in magnitude than its standard error of 0.0041."
Which \(\sigma\) value is the largest in the 'minutes' column and what is its value?,"\(\sigma_{1}\) has the largest value in the 'minutes' column, which is 5.265."
What was the criteria for selecting performances from runners?,Runners who achieved a minimum performance standard in 2015 or 2016 in at least one of the 22 selected marathons.
Did the time of the performances affect the selection?,"No, all performances were selected regardless of the time."
Over what period were the performances of the selected runners considered?,From 2015 to 2019.
What is the purpose of creating a dataset from marathons in 2015 and 2016?,The purpose is to find runners that met the minimum performance standard in any marathon in those years.
Why is there manual work involved in creating the marathon dataset?,Manual work is needed to know the url on marathonguide.com for every marathon.
What was the criteria for selecting the 22 marathons?,The marathons were selected based on whether runners had qualified for the U.S. Olympic trials and whether the marathons had many Boston Marathon Qualifiers.
Why do the authors avoid using causal language in the article?,"Because the study is observational rather than experimental, and making causal conclusions from observational data is difficult and controversial."
What is the treatment mentioned in the context?,Wearing Vaporflys
What is the outcome that the study is looking at?,Marathon time
What are the possible confounders mentioned in the discussion?,Fitness and price
Why might a runner in poor fitness be unwilling to pay for Mike Vaporflys?,Because they are expensive relative to other racing shoes
What might influence a runner's decision to not race in Mike Vaporflys despite trying them in training?,Not getting a benefit from them or personal objections to the fairness of the shoes
