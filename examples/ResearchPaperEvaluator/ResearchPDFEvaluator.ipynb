    "# Build Your Own Research Paper Agent: Transform a Unstructured Research Paper to an Finetuned LLM\n",
    "Do you want to build an agent so that you can ask it anything about a research paper? In this example, we will show you how use `uniflow` and `pykoi` to extract knowledge from a Nike research paper and then finetune an LLM on these knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll use `uniflow` to generate question-answers (QAs) from a pdf using OpenAI's models via `uniflow`'s `MultiFlowPipeline`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll use `pykoi` to run supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the QAs generated by `uniflow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll use `pykoi`'s Chatbot to run the SFT model, so you can ask questions about the 10K and get answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we're using a the paper \"An Observational Study of the Effect of Nike Vaporfly Shoes on Marathon Performance\" from Cornell.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Note: In order to run this notebook, you need a GPU (for the `RLHF`).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to set up a conda environment to run this notebook. You can set up the environment following the [instruction](https://github.com/CambioML/cambio-recipes/tree/main#installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using `uniflow` and several of the `pykoi` modules, so you will need to install these in your environment as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install uniflow\n",
    "pip3 install \"pykoi[huggingface, rag, rlhf]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, you will need to install torch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 uninstall torch\n",
    "pip3 install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121  # cu121 means cuda 12.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to run the code. Once you have the key, set it as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` within a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository.

However, our study differs in a few ways. First, instead of relying on a convenient sample of athletes who upload their data to Strava, we take an exhaustive sample of athletes who met a minimum performance standard at one of 22 of the largest marathon venues in 2015 and 2016 in the US and Canada. Second, instead of relying on self-reported shoe data, we searched the internet for photos of races and visually identified the shoes that runners wore. Third, we focus only on athletes who performed at an elite level before the Vaporflys were released to the public. Thus, we are only considering accomplished runners with marathon experience who, most likely, settled on a suitable shoe before the Vaporflys were released. These runners are also those most likely to be affected by shoe regulations because many of them compete in national Olympic qualifying races subject to regulations.</td>\n",
